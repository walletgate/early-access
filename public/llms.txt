## About

WalletGate was built to help developers prepare for the EU Digital Identity Wallet regulation before the 2027 deadline. Every EU member state is required to issue EUDI wallets to citizens, and businesses will need to verify these wallets for age-gated content, financial services, healthcare, and government interactions.
